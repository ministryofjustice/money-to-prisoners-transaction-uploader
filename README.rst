Transaction Uploader
====================

Reads Money to Prisoners (MTP) bank account to facilitate reconciliation.
Part of the `Prisoner Money suite of apps`_.

This app does not have a web interface. It's run as a cron-like jon.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.8+

Usage
-----

It's recommended that you use a python virtual environment to isolate each application.

The simplest way to do this is using:

.. code-block::

  python3 -m venv venv    # creates a virtual environment for dependencies; only needed the first time
  . venv/bin/activate     # activates the virtual environment; needed every time you use this app

Some build tasks expect the active virtual environment to be at ``/venv/``, but should generally work regardless of
its location.

You can copy ``mtp_transaction_uploader/local.py.sample`` to ``local.py`` to overlay local settings that won't be committed,
but itâ€™s not required for a standard setup.

The following environment variables determine how the uploader works:

.. code-block::

    SFTP_HOST - host to download data services files from
    SFTP_USER - sftp username
    SFTP_PRIVATE_KEY - private key for sftp user
    SFTP_DIR - directory on sftp host where files can be found

    API_USERNAME - username for API access
    API_PASSWORD - password for API access

    API_CLIENT_ID - API client ID
    API_CLIENT_SECRET - API client secret
    API_URL - base URL of API

    DS_LAST_DATE_FILE - path of file in which to store last date processed
    DS_NEW_FILES_DIR - path of directory in which to store downloaded files
